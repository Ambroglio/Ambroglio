# Ambroise Mullie

### 👋 Hello, I'm Ambroise, aka *Ambroglio* !

I'm French and I'm currently an Enterprise Architect at Adeo Services in aprenticeship for my last year of Master in Business Informatics !

I'm quite curious and eager to learn, always.

I'm interested in many different things, such as programming (of course) but also discovering and learning different cultures and languages (Spanish and Korean for example) ! 

I read a lot too (French Classics mostly, such as Les Rougon-Macquart, by Emile Zola, ever heard about ?).

### ✨ What are my favourite languages and frameworks ?

- Java (with or without Spring Boot) in order to create a great back-end, divided in microservices !
- Kotlin, a Java better than Java 💯
- Python, because I learned everything thanks to this language ! 🚀
- JavaScript, in order to have an immmediate rendering of your code ! 🎨
- React, because it's quite logical and works just like HTML !
- Material UI 😎

### 🌱 What am I currently learning ?

- UX/UI Design
- Blender
- Google Apps Script

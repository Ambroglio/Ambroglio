# Ambroise 

### 👋 Hello, I'm Ambroise, aka *Ambroglio* !

I'm French and I'm currently an Enterprise Architect at Adeo Services in aprenticeship for my last year of Master in Business Informatics !

I'm interested in many different things, such as programming (of course) but also discovering and learning different cultures and languages (Spanish and Korean for example) ! 

I read a lot too (French Classics mostly, such as Les Rougon-Macquart, by Emile Zola, ever heard about ?).

### ✨ What are my favourite languages and frameworks ?

- Java (with or without Spring Boot) in order to create a great back-end, divided in microservices !
- Kotlin, a Java better than Java 💯
- Python, because I learned everything thanks to this language ! 🚀
- JavaScript, in order to have an immmediate rendering of your code ! 🎨
- React, because it's quite logical and works just like HTML !
- Material UI 😎

### 🌱 What am I currently learning ?

- Redux linked with React
- UX/UI design

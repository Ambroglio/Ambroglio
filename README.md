# Ambroise Mullie

### 👋 Hello, I am Ambroise, aka *Ambroglio*!

I am French and I am a Developer for Desjardins via Acensia Canada. I currently live in Montréal, in Québec, Canada.

I'm quite curious and eager to learn, always.

I am interested in many different things, such as programming (of course) but also discovering and learning different cultures and languages (Spanish and Korean for example)! 

I read a lot too (French Classics mostly, such as Les Rougon-Macquart, by Emile Zola, ever heard about ?).

### ✨ What are my favourite languages and frameworks ?

- Java (with or without Spring Boot) in order to create a great back-end, divided in microservices
- Kotlin, a Java better than Java 💯
- Python, because I learned everything thanks to this language! 🚀
- JavaScript, in order to make scripts very easily
- React, because it's quite logical and works just like HTML
- Material UI, better than Bootstrap
- And many others that I certainly forgot....

### 🌱 What am I currently learning ?

- UX/UI Design
- Blender
- Google Apps Script
